Both expressions are commonly used to calculate the middle index in binary search. However, the second expression, `int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;`, is generally preferred for a couple of reasons:

1. **Prevention of Overflow**: In some cases, particularly when dealing with large values of `low` and `high`, `(low + high)` might exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an `int`, causing overflow. The second expression avoids this issue by subtracting `low` from `high` first, reducing the chance of overflow.

2. **Clarity**: The second expression explicitly shows the intention of calculating the difference between `high` and `low` first, then adding `low`. This can make the code more readable and understandable, especially for someone who might not be familiar with binary search algorithms.

3. **Consistency**: The second expression follows a consistent pattern of subtracting the lower bound from the upper bound to find the range, which aligns with the concept of binary search more closely.

In terms of efficiency, both expressions have similar computational complexity, so there's no significant difference in performance. However, considering the potential for overflow and the clarity of the code, the second expression is generally preferred.
