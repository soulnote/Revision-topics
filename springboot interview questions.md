- 📄 **Form**: Interested candidates for the same interview process can fill out the form below.

### Candidate Background
- 🎓 **Education**: Completed computer engineering in 2019.
- 🏢 **Experience**: Worked with companies like PCS, Scal AG, and Zebra Technologies.
- 💻 **Skills**: Focused on Java, Spring MVC, and Spring Boot.

### Recent Project
- 🛠️ **Project Overview**: Developed an end-to-end application involving Spring MVC and Hibernate.
- 🗃️ **Database**: Used Hibernate framework for database operations.
- 🔍 **Optimization**: Implemented indexing to optimize database queries.
- 🧩 **Architecture**: Worked on a monolithic architecture for a client project.
- 📤 **Third-Party Integration**: Used JSP libraries to convert Java data to XML for communication with third parties.

### Technical Knowledge
- 🛠️ **Packages**: Used packages to avoid naming collisions and organize code structure.
- ⚙️ **Static Keyword**: Discussed static variables, methods, blocks, and their behaviors.
- 🚫 **Method Overriding**: Clarified that static methods cannot be overridden.
- 🔄 **Execution Flow**: Described execution flow involving static and non-static methods.
- 💡 **Generics**: Has basic knowledge but is not fully confident about their use with arrays.
- ❗ **Exception Handling**: 
  - Discussed exceptions in static blocks and finally blocks.
  - Highlighted that custom exceptions are preferred for clarity.
  - Named some built-in exceptions like ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, etc.

### Spring Boot
- 🌱 **Advantages**: Auto-configures dependencies, provides embedded servers like Tomcat, and simplifies project setup.
- 🔄 **Auto-Configuration**: Uses annotations and classpath analysis to decide configurations.
- ⚙️ **Database Integration**: Steps include creating repository and entity classes, and using annotations like @Repository and @Entity.
- 🔐 **Security**: Aware of concepts like JWT and Spring Security for authorization and authentication.

### Miscellaneous
- ⚙️ **Singleton Design Pattern**: Created a singleton class and understood its usage.
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Can deploy Spring Boot applications as traditional WAR files.
- 🔄 **Configurations**: Knows about application configuration precedence and structure, though not deeply involved in current projects.
- 📊 **Optimization**: Suggested optimizing code by reducing complexity, avoiding unnecessary loops, and consolidating database queries.

### Potential Areas for Improvement
- 📚 **Learning**: Intends to gain hands-on knowledge in areas like security implementation before working on new projects.

### Key Points from the Interview

- 👨‍💻 **Introduction:**
  - Anit Kumar Davan with 3 years of experience in Java and Spring Boot.
  - Based in Pune, working at Accenture.
  - Experience with AWS, Bamboo, Sonar, and other tools.

- 📞 **Project Details:**
  - Working on an Australian telecommunications project.
  - Involvement with Java, Spring Boot, and microservices.

- 💻 **Technical Knowledge:**
  - **Printing without `main` method:** Not aware initially; explained using a static block.
  - **Static blocks:** Can have multiple; used for initializing static data members.
  - **Finally block:** Ensures resource closure; only one per try-catch pair.
  - **Collections:**
    - Difference between ArrayList (ordered, allows duplicates) and Set (unordered, no duplicates).
    - HashMap: Use of class as key with overridden `hashCode` and `equals` methods.
  - **Reflection:** Not aware; explained it as a feature to modify methods, classes, and interfaces.
  - **Functional Interfaces:** Explained and provided examples (Runnable, Comparator).
  - **Stream API:**
    - Difference between `filter` (reduces elements) and `map` (applies function to each element).
  - **Spring Boot vs. Spring:**
    - Spring Boot requires less configuration.
    - Can change embedded server.
    - Dependencies and bean scopes discussed.
  - **Caching:** Not implemented.
  - **Idempotent Methods:** Explained `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` for consistency.
  - **Request Param vs. Path Variable:** Difference in capturing data from URL.
  - **Annotations:** Various used (`@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, etc.).
  - **JPA Repository:** Provides database-related methods like `findAll`.
  - **Design Patterns:** Explained Singleton pattern and how to prevent cloning by overriding the `clone` method.

- 🌱 **Learning Points:**
  - Functional interface cannot extend another interface with abstract methods.
  - Singleton pattern prevention of cloning by overriding `clone` method and throwing an exception.
